# TIPE-Adaptive-Enemy-Behaviors
This project explores how enemy behaviors in a video game can dynamically adapt to the player's actions and skill level. The objective is to model and implement AI transformations that create a more responsive gameplay experience. The project includes behavior design and adaptive algorithms illustrating how AI evolves throughout the game.

Adaptive Game AI – TIPE Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for my TIPE project, which studies how enemy behaviors in a video game can adapt dynamically to the player’s actions and skill level. The goal is to illustrate how simple transformations of AI logic can create more reactive and engaging gameplay, while remaining explainable in the context of a scientific oral exam.

Project Overview :

The project focuses on implementing adaptive enemy behaviors in a simple arcade-style game. Instead of fixed patterns, enemies adjust their movement, firing rate, and strategy based on how the player performs. The adaptation relies on observable features such as accuracy, survival time or the player’s aggressiveness.

The objective is not to build a sophisticated AI, but to demonstrate how deterministic rules and state changes can give the impression of intelligence while remaining fully interpretable.

Main Concepts : 

Transformation of enemy behavior based on player performance

Simple player modelling using in-game statistics

Adaptive difficulty through controlled parameter changes

Fully explainable decision-making (no black box methods)

Features : 

Modular AI architecture with several behavior states

Adaptation through playing, each game you get affected an level that give you enemies around your estimated level

Small visual indicators to track behavior changes during a run
