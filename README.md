# TIPE-Adaptive-Enemy-Behaviors
This project explores how enemy behaviors in a video game can dynamically adapt to the player's actions and skill level. The objective is to model and implement AI transformations that create a more responsive gameplay experience. The project includes behavior design and adaptive algorithms illustrating how AI evolves throughout the game.
